AS A traveler
YOU WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT YOU can plan a trip accordingly
```

The current conditions will display the city's name, date, an icon representation of conditions, the temperature in °F, winds in MPH, the humidity percentage, and a color indicated UV index. The UV index will display green for favorable levels 1-2, yellow for moderate levels 3-5, and red for severe levels 6+. Beneath the 5-Day Forecast displays the date, an icon for conditions, the temperature, winds, and humidty levels for each day. Users will be able to see their previously searched locations in the left sidebar, and can select them to view them all over again.
